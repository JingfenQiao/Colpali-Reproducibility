Some weights of ColPali were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /ivi/ilps/personal/jqiao/models/paligemma-3b-mix-448 and are newly initialized: ['custom_text_proj.bias', 'custom_text_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
